# Product Context: Inn Hotels

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Traditional hotel management systems are often fragmented, requiring separate systems for:
- Room reservations and front desk operations
- Restaurant POS and food service billing
- Financial management and accounting
- Guest services and amenities
- Housekeeping and maintenance
- Electronic access control (door locks, key cards)

This fragmentation leads to:
- **Data Silos**: Information trapped in separate systems
- **Manual Reconciliation**: Staff manually transferring data between systems
- **Errors and Discrepancies**: Inconsistent data across different platforms
- **Operational Inefficiency**: Multiple logins, different interfaces, training overhead
- **Limited Visibility**: No unified view of hotel performance and guest experience

### The Solution
Inn Hotels provides a **unified, integrated platform** that consolidates all hotel operations into a single, cohesive system built on the robust Frappe framework.

## How It Should Work

### **Unified Guest Journey**
1. **Reservation**: Guest books room through any channel (direct, OTA, phone)
2. **Check-in**: Front desk processes arrival, issues key cards, activates WiFi
3. **Stay Management**: All charges (room, food, amenities) automatically post to guest folio
4. **Check-out**: Consolidated billing with multiple payment options
5. **Post-stay**: Follow-up communications, feedback collection

### **Integrated Operations**
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Changes in one module immediately reflect across all others
- **Seamless POS Integration**: Restaurant charges automatically appear on guest folios
- **Automated Workflows**: Housekeeping updates, room status changes, billing processes
- **Unified Reporting**: Single source of truth for all hotel metrics

### **Smart Automation**
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Automatic rate adjustments based on occupancy and demand
- **Inventory Management**: Real-time tracking of room availability and amenities
- **Revenue Optimization**: Package bundling, upselling opportunities, yield management
- **Compliance Automation**: Audit trails, tax calculations, regulatory reporting

## User Experience Goals
