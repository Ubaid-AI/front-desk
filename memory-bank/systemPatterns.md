# System Patterns: Inn Hotels

## System Architecture

### **Framework Foundation**
- **Base Platform**: Frappe Framework (Python-based ERP)
- **Database**: MySQL with InnoDB engine for ACID compliance
- **Architecture Pattern**: Document-based system with custom DocTypes
- **Frontend**: Frappe's built-in web interface with JavaScript extensions

### **Core Design Principles**
1. **Single Source of Truth**: All data stored in centralized database
2. **Document-Centric**: Operations revolve around core document types
3. **Event-Driven**: Actions trigger cascading updates across modules
4. **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions for different user types
5. **Real-Time Synchronization**: Immediate data consistency across all modules
6. **Performance-First**: ✅ **NEW** - Optimized query patterns for scalability

## Key Technical Decisions

### **Data Model Architecture**
```
Core Entities:
├── Inn Customer (Guest Management)
├── Inn Room (Physical Room Management)
├── Inn Reservation (Booking Management)
├── Inn Folio (Financial Management)
├── Inn POS Usage (Restaurant Integration)
├── Inn Shift (Staff Management & Cash Register)
└── Inn Audit Log (Compliance & Tracking)
```

### **Integration Patterns**
- **API-First Design**: External system integration through standardized APIs
- **Webhook Support**: Real-time notifications for system events
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and business rule enforcement
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and comprehensive error logging

### **Security Architecture**
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Granular access control at document and field levels
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all system changes and user actions
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Session Management**: Secure user session handling and timeout controls

## Component Relationships

### **Core Module Dependencies**
```
Reservation System
├── Depends on: Customer, Room, Rate Management
├── Triggers: Folio Creation, Room Status Update
└── Integrates with: Channel Management, Payment Systems

Folio Management
├── Depends on: Reservation, Room, POS Usage
├── Triggers: Payment Processing, Audit Logging
└── Integrates with: Accounting, Tax Systems

POS Integration
├── Depends on: Table Management, Menu Items
├── Triggers: Folio Updates, Revenue Recognition
└── Integrates with: Restaurant Operations, Guest Billing

Shift Management ✅ **NEW**
├── Depends on: Folio, Reservation, Payment Systems
├── Triggers: Cash Register Operations, Performance Monitoring
└── Integrates with: Staff Management, Financial Reconciliation
```

### **Data Flow Patterns**
1. **Reservation → Check-in**: Creates folio, updates room status, activates services
2. **POS Usage → Folio**: Automatically posts charges to guest accounts
3. **Check-out → Settlement**: Processes payments, closes folios, updates audit logs
4. **Day-end → Reconciliation**: Balances all transactions, generates reports
5. **Shift Management → Performance**: ✅ **NEW** - Optimized data retrieval for cash register operations

## Design Patterns in Use

### **Document Lifecycle Management**
- **State Machines**: Reservation status transitions (Reserved → In House → Finished)
- **Workflow Automation**: Automated processes for common operations
- **Version Control**: Document amendment and change tracking
- **Approval Workflows**: Multi-level approval for critical operations

### **Integration Patterns**
- **Event Sourcing**: Track all changes for audit and rollback capabilities
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models for performance optimization
- **Microservices**: Modular design for scalability and maintenance
- **API Gateway**: Centralized API management and security

### **Performance Optimization** ✅ **SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED**
- **Database Indexing**: Strategic indexing for common query patterns
- **Query Consolidation**: ✅ **NEW** - Eliminated N+1 query problem in shift management
- **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent caching for frequently accessed data
- **Lazy Loading**: Load data only when needed
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of bulk operations
- **Consolidated Queries**: ✅ **NEW** - Single query operations instead of multiple loops

### **Query Optimization Patterns** ✅ **NEW**
```
Before (N+1 Problem):
├── 1 query for reservations
├── N queries for folio names (one per reservation)
├── N queries for folio transactions (one per folio)
└── Total: 2N+1 queries (could be 1000+ queries!)

After (Consolidated):
├── 1 consolidated query using SQL UNION
├── JOINs for efficient data retrieval
├── Single result set processing
└── Total: 1 query (massive performance improvement)
```

### **Code Organization Patterns** ✅ **NEW**
```
Optimized Method Structure:
├── Main orchestrator function
├── Context determination helper
├── Consolidated query executor
├── Data processor
└── Result aggregator

Benefits:
├── Eliminated code duplication
├── Improved maintainability
├── Better error handling
└── Enhanced performance
```

## Technical Constraints & Considerations

### **Framework Limitations**
- **Frappe Dependencies**: Must work within Frappe's architectural constraints
- **Database Compatibility**: MySQL-specific optimizations and features
- **Frontend Framework**: Limited to Frappe's UI components and JavaScript APIs

### **Scalability Considerations** ✅ **IMPROVED**
- **Multi-Property Support**: Architecture must support multiple hotel locations
- **Concurrent Users**: Handle multiple staff members accessing system simultaneously
- **Data Volume**: ✅ **OPTIMIZED** - Now efficiently manage large amounts of transaction data
- **Performance**: ✅ **SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED** - Maintain responsiveness under load

### **Integration Requirements**
- **External APIs**: Door lock systems, payment gateways, WiFi providers
- **Data Formats**: Support for various import/export formats
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate synchronization across all connected systems
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of external system failures

## Performance Optimization Architecture ✅ **NEW**

### **Query Consolidation Strategy**
- **Single Query Approach**: Replace multiple database calls with consolidated operations
- **SQL UNION Pattern**: Combine guest and master/desk folio queries efficiently
- **JOIN Optimization**: Use proper table relationships for data retrieval
- **Parameter Binding**: Safe SQL execution with proper parameter handling

### **Code Refactoring Patterns**
- **Helper Function Extraction**: Separate concerns into focused, reusable functions
- **Context Management**: Centralized shift context determination
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Streamlined data transformation and aggregation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management and logging

### **Performance Monitoring**
- **Execution Time Tracking**: Measure and log method performance
- **Query Analysis**: Monitor database query performance
- **Memory Usage**: Track memory consumption during operations
- **Scalability Metrics**: Measure performance under various load conditions

## Future Architecture Considerations

### **Technology Evolution**
- **Cloud Deployment**: Support for cloud-based hosting and scaling
- **Mobile Applications**: Native mobile apps for staff and guests
