# System Patterns: Inn Hotels

## System Architecture

### **Framework Foundation**
- **Base Platform**: Frappe Framework (Python-based ERP)
- **Database**: MySQL with InnoDB engine for ACID compliance
- **Architecture Pattern**: Document-based system with custom DocTypes
- **Frontend**: Frappe's built-in web interface with JavaScript extensions

### **Core Design Principles**
1. **Single Source of Truth**: All data stored in centralized database
2. **Document-Centric**: Operations revolve around core document types
3. **Event-Driven**: Actions trigger cascading updates across modules
4. **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions for different user types
5. **Real-Time Synchronization**: Immediate data consistency across all modules

## Key Technical Decisions

### **Data Model Architecture**
```
Core Entities:
├── Inn Customer (Guest Management)
├── Inn Room (Physical Room Management)
├── Inn Reservation (Booking Management)
├── Inn Folio (Financial Management)
├── Inn POS Usage (Restaurant Integration)
└── Inn Audit Log (Compliance & Tracking)
```

### **Integration Patterns**
- **API-First Design**: External system integration through standardized APIs
- **Webhook Support**: Real-time notifications for system events
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and business rule enforcement
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and comprehensive error logging

### **Security Architecture**
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Granular access control at document and field levels
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all system changes and user actions
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Session Management**: Secure user session handling and timeout controls

## Component Relationships

### **Core Module Dependencies**
```
Reservation System
├── Depends on: Customer, Room, Rate Management
├── Triggers: Folio Creation, Room Status Update
└── Integrates with: Channel Management, Payment Systems

Folio Management
├── Depends on: Reservation, Room, POS Usage
├── Triggers: Payment Processing, Audit Logging
└── Integrates with: Accounting, Tax Systems

POS Integration
├── Depends on: Table Management, Menu Items
├── Triggers: Folio Updates, Revenue Recognition
└── Integrates with: Restaurant Operations, Guest Billing
```

### **Data Flow Patterns**
1. **Reservation → Check-in**: Creates folio, updates room status, activates services
2. **POS Usage → Folio**: Automatically posts charges to guest accounts
3. **Check-out → Settlement**: Processes payments, closes folios, updates audit logs
4. **Day-end → Reconciliation**: Balances all transactions, generates reports

## Design Patterns in Use

### **Document Lifecycle Management**
- **State Machines**: Reservation status transitions (Reserved → In House → Finished)
- **Workflow Automation**: Automated processes for common operations
- **Version Control**: Document amendment and change tracking
- **Approval Workflows**: Multi-level approval for critical operations

### **Integration Patterns**
- **Event Sourcing**: Track all changes for audit and rollback capabilities
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models for performance optimization
- **Microservices**: Modular design for scalability and maintenance
- **API Gateway**: Centralized API management and security

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Database Indexing**: Strategic indexing for common query patterns
- **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent caching for frequently accessed data
- **Lazy Loading**: Load data only when needed
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of bulk operations

## Technical Constraints & Considerations

### **Framework Limitations**
- **Frappe Dependencies**: Must work within Frappe's architectural constraints
- **Database Compatibility**: MySQL-specific optimizations and features
- **Frontend Framework**: Limited to Frappe's UI components and JavaScript APIs

### **Scalability Considerations**
- **Multi-Property Support**: Architecture must support multiple hotel locations
- **Concurrent Users**: Handle multiple staff members accessing system simultaneously
- **Data Volume**: Manage large amounts of transaction and guest data
- **Performance**: Maintain responsiveness under load

### **Integration Requirements**
- **External APIs**: Door lock systems, payment gateways, WiFi providers
- **Data Formats**: Support for various import/export formats
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate synchronization across all connected systems
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of external system failures

## Future Architecture Considerations

### **Technology Evolution**
- **Cloud Deployment**: Support for cloud-based hosting and scaling
- **Mobile Applications**: Native mobile apps for staff and guests
- **AI Integration**: Machine learning for pricing optimization and guest preferences
- **IoT Integration**: Smart room controls and sensor integration

### **Scalability Planning**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Support for distributed database architectures
- **Load Balancing**: Efficient distribution of system load
- **Microservices Migration**: Gradual transition to microservices architecture
- **API Versioning**: Maintain backward compatibility during evolution
